CatLog Donate is simply an add-on to the free CatLog, \
meaning you\'ll still need to install that version in order for it to work. \
Thanks for donating! :)</string>
    <string name="thanks">\
While installed, CatLog Donate will unlock the \"Color Scheme\" setting and serve as proof \
that you donated. \
This icon will remove itself from your application \
tray the next time you reboot. Thanks for donating - you are awesome! :)</string>
